        React Portals provide a way to render a componentâ€™s output outside of
        its parent DOM hierarchy. This allows you to "portal" the children of a
        component to a different part of the DOM tree, even if that part is
        outside the normal React component tree structure.Normally, when React
        renders a component, it does so within the parent component's DOM
        container, but with portals, you can render a child component into a
        completely different part of the DOM, even outside the parent component.
        React portal is useful for things like <strong>Modal</strong>,
        <strong>Popups</strong>, <strong>Overlay</strong> e.t.c
